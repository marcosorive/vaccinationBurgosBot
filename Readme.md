# Vaccination in Burgos üíâ
## What is this? ü§ñ
This is a telegram bot.
## What does it do? ‚ùì
It notifies you when the vaccination points/dates in the province of Burgos (or Le√≥n, or other if you deploy it) change.
## Why does this even exists? ü§î
Because the health department of Castilla y Le√≥n does not notify you when it's your time to get vaccinated. And I got tired of checking the website.
## Data source üíæ
- [Here for Burgos](https://www.saludcastillayleon.es/es/covid-19-poblacion/vacunacion-covid-19/lugares-vacunacion/burgos)

# Run the docker container
- You need a .env file with a variable called BOT_API_KEY that contains the telegram api key.
- You also need another env variable with the mongo DB URL.
- You also need a bot.log file where docker can mount the volume. It should be empty for the first execution. 
- The container is built for linux/amd64 and linux/arm/v7.
Use the following script to run it:
```sudo docker run -d --env-file ./.env -v $(pwd)/bot.log:/app/bot.log morive/vaccinationburgosbot:latest```

# Customization
There are 2 other environmental variable that you can use:
- **DATA_URL**: to change the URL to request the data. You can find the valid ones [here](https://www.saludcastillayleon.es/es/covid-19-poblacion/vacunacion-covid-19/lugares-vacunacion) The default URL is for Burgos.
- **TIME_TO_CHECK_SECS**: seconds between checks. Defaults to 3600 seconds. (1hour)
