# Vaccination in Burgos 💉
## What is this? 🤖
This is a telegram bot.
## What does it do? ❓
It notifies you when the vaccination points/dates in the province of Burgos change.
## Why does this even exists? 🤔
Because the health department of Castilla y León does not notify you when it's your time to get vaccinated. And I got tired of checking the website.
